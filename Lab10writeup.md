1. When compared with the action potential with values assumed for an hAVCM, these values produce an action potential with a longer plateau,
AKA a wider hump in the middle of the action potential (longer lasting AP). If we are testing drugs on these cells that block time-dependent K+ channels would result in an even wider plateau and longer lasting action potential (k+ will not be able to hyperpolarize the depolarized cell)

2. After importing and normalizing the data by the maximum value, to mimic what is seen in the data, the model is changed so that it stimulates with the applied current at the time of each peak in the dataset which was found by visually inspected the data. Other values were then adjusted to get the model to match the data. The value of PCaL was multiplied by 2.5. This allows for a wider bump in the spike to match the data. Gk1 max and Gk2 mac were decreased by factors of .6 and .77. This weakens the hyperpolarzing effect of the potassium and widens the potassium. The inward rectifying potassium change actually keeps the shape of the action potential with the widened hump, similar to how calcium does. The initial conditions of voltage, m, h, n, d, and f were -89, .1,.1,.01,.1 and .1 as shown in solution and can be found by trial an error, allowing the model trace to better fit the shape of the data. These variables affect the starting voltage and gating variables which effect the entire shape of the response.
